================================

Forked from Dipanjan Das's [Semi-Supervised POS tagging code](https://code.google.com/p/semi-supervised-pos-tagging/)
as used in his ACL 2011 papers. Dipanjan's code extends code from Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick (NAACL 2010 paper).

Note: `edu.cmu.cs.lti.ark.ssl.pos.multicore.HelloEclipseWorld.java` depends on an MPI library which must be obtained separately. 
If MPI is not needed, simply remove that file from the build path to avoid compile errors.
